We analysed the global mRNA structure of polyribosome-associated mRNAs defined in a previous study21, 
ranking the transcripts according to their polyribosome-associated mRNA abundance relative to their mRNA abundance. 
We selected the top 5% (1,136 mRNAs) and the bottom 5% (1,136 mRNAs) of mRNAs from the ranking.
 We defined the top 5% as the ‘high translation efficiency mRNAs’ and the bottom 5% as the ‘low translation efficiency mRNAs’. 
 We analysed the global transcriptome trends of DMS reactivity of the 5′ UTR, 
 CDS and 3′ UTR for both the high translation efficiency mRNAs and the low translation efficiency mRNAs (Fig. 3a).

Codon periodicity and codon position signature. We assessed the codon periodicity by applying a discrete Fourier transform.
 We collected the DMS reactivity data from the Fourier-transformed patterns of the 40-nt 5′ UTR, the first 100 nt of the CDS, 
 the last 100 nt of the CDS and the 40-nt 3′ UTR regions (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5b). 
 We also computed the average DMS reactivity for each codon position, 
 collected from the entire CDS across 22,721 unique mRNAs (see above for explanation of mRNAs chosen). 
 We applied the Student’s t-test to assess the significance of the difference between the average DMS reactivity for different
 codon positions (P < 0.01 as significant) (Extended Data Fig. 5c). 
 The same methodology was applied to the high and low translation efficiency mRNA subsets (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5d).
